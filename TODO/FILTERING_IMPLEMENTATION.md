# Unified Filtering Framework Implementation

## Overview

The unified filtering framework has been fully implemented, providing a generic, trait-based approach to filtering various data types. This implementation follows the plan outlined in `TODO/REFACTORING.md` and addresses all requirements for a concise codebase with no duplicate code.

## Key Components

### 1. Generic Filter Trait

The core of the framework is the `Filter<T>` trait in `src/filter/generic.rs`:

```rust
pub trait Filter<T>: Debug {
    fn apply(&self, input: &T) -> Result<T>;
    fn required_resources(&self) -> HashSet<String>;
}
```

This trait works with any data type, making it suitable for both Arrow/Parquet filtering and domain entity filtering.

### 2. Core Filter Implementations

We've implemented the following core filters:

- `IncludeAllFilter` - Always includes all elements
- `ExcludeAllFilter` - Always excludes all elements
- `AndFilter<T, F>` - Combines filters with logical AND
- `OrFilter<T, F>` - Combines filters with logical OR
- `NotFilter<T, F>` - Negates another filter

### 3. Combinators and Extension Trait

The `FilterExt` trait provides extension methods for composing filters:

```rust
pub trait FilterExt<T: Clone + Debug + Send + Sync + 'static>: Filter<T> + Sized {
    fn and<F: Filter<T> + Send + Sync + 'static>(self, other: F) -> BoxedFilter<T>;
    fn or<F: Filter<T> + Send + Sync + 'static>(self, other: F) -> BoxedFilter<T>;
    fn not(self) -> BoxedFilter<T>;
}
```

This allows for fluent chaining of filter operations:

```rust
let complex_filter = filter1.and(filter2).or(filter3).not();
```

### 4. Filter Builder

The `FilterBuilder` provides a pattern for constructing complex filters:

```rust
let filter = FilterBuilder::new()
    .add_filter(filter1)
    .add_filter(filter2)
    .build_and();
```

### 5. Type Erasure with BoxedFilter

The `BoxedFilter` type allows for storing any filter implementation, regardless of its concrete type:

```rust
pub struct BoxedFilter<T: Clone + Debug + Send + Sync + 'static> {
    inner: std::sync::Arc<dyn Filter<T> + Send + Sync>,
}
```

### 6. Adapter Pattern

The adapter pattern in `src/filter/adapter.rs` allows converting between different filter types:

- `BatchFilterAdapter` - Adapts `BatchFilter` to `Filter<RecordBatch>`
- `EntityFilterAdapter` - Adapts `Filter<T>` to `BatchFilter`
- `EntityToBatchAdapter` - Converts entity filters to batch filters

### 7. Filter Registry

The `FilterRegistry` provides a factory pattern for creating filters from names and parameters:

```rust
let factory = FilterRegistry::new()
    .register::<AgeRangeFilter>("age")
    .register::<GenderFilter>("gender");

let filter = factory.create_filter::<Individual>("age", &params)?;
```

## Examples

Three comprehensive example files demonstrate the framework's capabilities:

1. `src/examples/filter_example.rs` - Basic usage of the generic filter framework
2. `src/examples/filter_migration_example.rs` - Migration from legacy to new filters
3. `src/examples/matching_filter_example.rs` - Adapting matching criteria to use the framework

## Migration Document

A detailed migration guide is provided in `FILTER_MIGRATION.md`, which explains:

- Benefits of the new system
- How to implement the Filter trait
- Converting legacy filters
- Composing filters
- Gradual migration strategy
- Common filter patterns

## Domain-Specific Implementations

The framework includes specific implementations for domain entities:

- `IndividualFilter` - For filtering Individual entities
- `FamilyFilter` - For filtering Family entities
- `MatchingCriteriaFilter` - Adapts matching criteria to use the Filter trait

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Unified API** - Single approach for all filtering operations
2. **Reduced Duplication** - Shared implementations for common filter patterns
3. **Type Safety** - Compile-time checking of filter and entity types
4. **Composability** - Simple ways to combine filters
5. **Resource Tracking** - Explicit declaration of required fields/columns
6. **Clean Adaptation** - Easy migration path from legacy systems
7. **Extensibility** - Simple to add new filter types

## Conclusion

The unified filtering framework is now complete and ready for use throughout the codebase. The implementation is both powerful and flexible, allowing for a gradual migration from the existing filtering approaches while maintaining backward compatibility.

The examples and documentation provide comprehensive guidance for developers to understand and use the new system effectively.
