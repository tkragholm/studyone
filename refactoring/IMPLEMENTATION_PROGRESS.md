# Implementation Progress

This document tracks our progress implementing the code cleanup plan outlined in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (Week 1)

- [x] Analyze models for redundancy
- [x] Analyze registry for redundancy
- [x] Create removal plan for obsolete code
- [x] Create sample implementations
- [x] Create migration guides

## Phase 2: Registry Migration (Weeks 2-3)

### Week 2: Initial Registry Migration

1. **Registry Implementations**
   - [x] Create trait-based BEF register implementation (`bef_new.rs`)
   - [x] Create trait-based IND register implementation (`ind_new.rs`) - completed and integrated
   - [x] Create trait-based LPR register implementation (`lpr2_new.rs`) - completed and integrated

## Phase 3: Model Cleanup (Week 4)

1. **Clean Up Individual Model**
   - [x] Create clean implementation without registry dependencies (`individual_new.rs`)
   - [x] Move registry-specific methods to registry files
   - [x] Create BEF model conversion implementation (`bef_model_conversion_new.rs`)
   - [x] Create IND model conversion implementation (`ind_model_conversion_new.rs`)
   - [x] Create registry-aware implementation (`registry_aware_models.rs`)

## Next Steps

1. **Update Import References**
   - [x] Update imports in IND registry files
   - [ ] Update imports in other registry and model files

2. **Integration Testing**
   - [x] Create tests for the IND registry implementation
   - [x] Validate the BEF registry implementation
   - [x] Validate the LPR registry implementation
   - [ ] Run comprehensive integration tests to ensure functionality is preserved

3. **Rename Files**
   - [x] Integrate IND registry from _new.rs files
   - [ ] After confirming functionality, integrate remaining _new.rs files

4. **Implement Remaining Tasks**
   - [x] Migrate IND registry
   - [x] Migrate LPR registry
   - [ ] Migrate MFR registry
   - [ ] Clean up other model files
   - [ ] Update the factory classes

## Completed Components

1. **Registry Implementations**
   - BEF registry using trait-based approach
   - IND registry using trait-based approach
   - LPR registry using trait-based approach

2. **Model Implementations**
   - Individual model without registry dependencies
   - Registry-specific conversions moved to appropriate files

## Key Improvements

1. **Cleaner Model Structure**
   - Removed registry-specific dependencies from models
   - Models now focus on domain behavior only

2. **Better Trait Organization**
   - Registry-specific traits implemented in registry files
   - Registry-aware behavior centralized in dedicated file

3. **Standardized Loaders**
   - All registry loaders now use the trait-based approach
   - Consistent pattern for async loading, filtering, etc.

4. **Improved Testability**
   - Registry conversion logic can be tested independently
   - Models can be tested without registry dependencies

## Lessons Learned from IND Registry Migration

1. **Trait Implementation Conflicts**
   - Discovered that trait implementations must be unique across the codebase
   - Found conflicts when IndRegistry was implemented for Individual in both models/individual.rs and registry/ind/conversion.rs
   - Resolution: Keep trait implementations in a single location (typically in the model files)

2. **Value Conversion Issues**
   - Encountered type conversion issues with LiteralValue from i32 in filter expressions
   - Solution: Explicitly convert using LiteralValue::Int(i64::from(value)) rather than value.into()
   - This clarified that some Into/From implementations are not available and require explicit conversion

3. **Code Organization Patterns**
   - Trait-based approach enables clearer separation of concerns:
     - Register loaders focus on data access
     - Model conversion traits handle data transformation
     - Registry-specific traits (e.g., IndRegistry) define behavior for specific registries
   - Integration between registers and the new trait system required careful handling of imports and dependencies

4. **Import Management**
   - Need to be vigilant about managing imports to avoid unused imports
   - Refactoring can lead to redundant imports that must be cleaned up

## Remaining Challenges

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Need to verify all registry implementations work correctly
   - Integration tests must confirm compatibility with existing code
   - Specifically need to test the IND registry with year filtering

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
   - Provide examples of using the new trait-based system

3. **Code Duplication**
   - Identify and eliminate any remaining duplication
   - Ensure consistent patterns across all registries
   - MFR registry still needs to be updated to match the trait-based pattern used in BEF, IND, and LPR
