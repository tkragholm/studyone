# Registry Migration Progress Report

This document tracks the progress of migrating all registry implementations to the new trait-based approach with integrated model conversion support.

| DOD      | ✅                        | ❌              | ✅    | Partial |
| DODSAARSAG| ✅                       | ❌              | ✅    | Partial |

## Factory Methods

All factory methods have been updated to support the new trait-based approach:

- ✅ `registry_from_name` now creates trait-based registry loaders
- ✅ `registry_from_path` now creates trait-based registry loaders
- ✅ Added `model_converting_registry_from_name` for model conversion support
- ✅ Added `load_as_individuals` and `load_as_individuals_async` helper functions
- ✅ Added `load_multiple_registries_as_individuals` for batch loading
- ✅ Added specialized type handling for model conversion

## Model Conversion Support

The following registries support direct model conversion to domain models:

| Registry | Individual | Income | Diagnosis | Family | Child | Parent |
|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| BEF      | ✅        | ❌     | ❌        | ✅     | ✅    | ✅     |
| IND      | ❌        | ✅     | ❌        | ❌     | ❌    | ❌     |
| LPR      | ❌        | ❌     | ✅        | ❌     | ❌    | ❌     |
| MFR      | ❌        | ❌     | ❌        | ❌     | ✅    | ❌     |
| AKM      | ✅        | ❌     | ❌        | ❌     | ❌    | ❌     |
| UDDF     | ✅        | ❌     | ❌        | ❌     | ❌    | ❌     |
| VNDS     | ✅        | ❌     | ❌        | ❌     | ❌    | ❌     |

## Recent Implementations

### AKM, UDDF, and VNDS Registry Implementations

- ✅ Created trait-based `AkmRegister` implementation
- ✅ Created trait-based `UddfRegister` implementation
- ✅ Created trait-based `VndsRegister` implementation
- ✅ Implemented `ModelConversion<Individual>` for all three registries
- ✅ Updated model conversion traits to support generic type parameters
- ✅ Added helper traits in models to support direct conversion
- ✅ Fixed method ambiguity issues in adapter files

### Factory Method Improvements

- ✅ Created specialized model conversion factory functions
- ✅ Added type checking to ensure correct model type parameters
- ✅ Used unsafe transmute for generic type parameter conversion (with runtime type safety)
- ✅ Refactored to prevent trait object casting errors
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for unsupported registry types

## Next Steps

1. Implement the remaining IDAN registry
2. Add model conversion support for remaining registries (DOD, DODSAARSAG)
3. Continue with model cleanup to remove registry-specific code
4. Complete integration tests for the new implementations

## Issues Resolved

1. Fixed method ambiguity in adapter files by using fully qualified syntax
2. Resolved type parameter issues in factory methods with safe transmute pattern
3. Added proper type annotations to address inference issues
4. Implemented combined traits for model converting registry loaders
