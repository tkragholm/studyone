# Implementation Plan for Code Cleanup

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for removing old code and migrating to the new trait-based approach.

## Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (Week 1)

- [x] Analyze models for redundancy
- [x] Analyze registry for redundancy
- [x] Create removal plan for obsolete code
- [x] Create sample implementations
- [x] Create migration guides

## Phase 2: Registry Migration (Weeks 2-3)

### Week 2: Initial Registry Migration

1. **Migrate BEF Registry**
   - [ ] Create trait-based BEF register implementation
   - [ ] Update model conversion in BEF registry
   - [ ] Add tests for the new implementation
   - [ ] Remove old implementation

2. **Migrate IND Registry**
   - [ ] Create trait-based IND register implementation
   - [ ] Update model conversion in IND registry
   - [ ] Add tests for the new implementation
   - [ ] Remove old implementation

3. **Migrate LPR Registry**
   - [ ] Create trait-based LPR register implementation
   - [ ] Update model conversion in LPR registry
   - [ ] Add tests for the new implementation
   - [ ] Remove implementation

### Week 3: Complete Registry Migration

4. **Migrate Remaining Registries**
   - [ ] Create trait-based implementations for all remaining registries
   - [ ] Update all model conversions
   - [ ] Add tests for all new implementations
   - [ ] Remove all old implementations

5. **Update Factory Methods**
   - [ ] Update registry factory methods to use new implementations
   - [ ] Test factory with new implementations
   - [ ] Update registry_from_name and registry_from_path methods

## Phase 3: Model Cleanup (Week 4)

6. **Clean Up Individual Model**
   - [ ] Move registry-specific methods to registry files
   - [ ] Remove registry-specific imports
   - [ ] Update references to use trait implementations
   - [ ] Add tests for refactored implementation

7. **Clean Up Child and Parent Models**
   - [ ] Move registry-specific methods to registry files
   - [ ] Remove registry-specific imports
   - [ ] Update references to use trait implementations
   - [ ] Add tests for refactored implementation

8. **Clean Up Family Model**
   - [ ] Move registry-specific methods to registry files
   - [ ] Remove registry-specific imports
   - [ ] Update references to use trait implementations
   - [ ] Add tests for refactored implementation

9. **Clean Up Remaining Models**
   - [ ] Move registry-specific methods to registry files
   - [ ] Remove registry-specific imports
   - [ ] Update references to use trait implementations
   - [ ] Add tests for refactored implementation

## Phase 4: Integration Testing and Finalization (Week 5)

10. **Integration Testing**
    - [ ] Run all integration tests
    - [ ] Verify registry loading functionality
    - [ ] Verify model conversion functionality
    - [ ] Verify filtering functionality
    - [ ] Fix any issues discovered

11. **Documentation Update**
    - [ ] Update all documentation to reflect new approach
    - [ ] Add examples for trait-based approach
    - [ ] Document migration process for external users
    - [ ] Update README with new approach

12. **Remove Deprecated Code**
    - [ ] Remove old registry implementation functions
    - [ ] Remove old filtering functions
    - [ ] Remove old model conversion methods
    - [ ] Clean up any other deprecated code

## Phase 5: Performance Testing and Optimization (Week 6)

13. **Performance Testing**
    - [ ] Benchmark old vs new implementation
    - [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
    - [ ] Optimize critical paths
    - [ ] Document performance improvements

14. **Final Review and Release**
    - [ ] Conduct code review of all changes
    - [ ] Address review feedback
    - [ ] Create release notes
    - [ ] Tag release version

## Task Assignments

For each phase, tasks will be assigned to team members based on their expertise:

- **Registry Migration**: Team members with registry expertise
- **Model Cleanup**: Team members with model expertise
- **Integration Testing**: QA team members
- **Documentation**: Technical writers and developers

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked through:

1. Weekly status meetings
2. Task status updates in the project management system
3. CI/CD pipeline build and test results

## Definition of Done

A task is considered done when:

1. The implementation is complete
2. All tests pass
3. The code has been reviewed
4. Documentation has been updated
5. The change has been verified in the integration environment

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered, we will:

1. Keep both old and new implementations in parallel until validated
2. Have the ability to toggle between implementations
3. Maintain regression test suite to validate equivalence

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. All registries use the new trait-based approach
2. All models are free of registry-specific code
3. Performance is equal to or better than the previous implementation
4. Code complexity and duplication are reduced
5. All tests pass and coverage is maintained or improved
