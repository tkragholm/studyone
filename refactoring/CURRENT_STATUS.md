# Current Project Status

## Overview

The project is currently in the process of migrating from an ad-hoc, function-based registry and model implementation to a more structured, trait-based approach. This migration improves code organization, reduces duplication, and enables more flexible integration between registry data and domain models.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Registry Migration
- Completed migration of 7 out of 10 registry implementations to trait-based approach
- Added direct model conversion support for AKM, UDDF, and VNDS registries
- Implemented generic model conversion traits for all supported models
- Created combined trait interfaces to simplify usage

### Factory Methods
- Updated all factory methods to support trait-based registries
- Added specialized model conversion factory functions
- Implemented type-safe generic handling for model conversion
- Created utility functions for direct model loading

### Error Handling
- Improved error reporting for unsupported registry types
- Added runtime type checking for model conversion
- Fixed compile-time issues with trait implementations

## Current Challenges

1. **Type Parameter Handling**: We encountered challenges with trait objects having different generic type parameters. This was resolved using a safe transmute pattern with runtime type checking.

2. **Method Ambiguity**: Multiple implementations of the same method name caused ambiguity in the codebase. This was fixed by using fully qualified method syntax to specify which trait implementation to use.

3. **Registry-Model Coupling**: Domain models still contain some registry-specific code. This needs to be moved to the registry implementations as part of the model cleanup phase.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Registry Migration**:
   - Implement IDAN registry (remaining registry)
   - Add model conversion for DOD and DODSAARSAG registries

2. **Begin Model Cleanup**:
   - Move registry-specific methods out of model files
   - Remove registry-specific imports from models
   - Update references to use trait implementations

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test all registry implementations with the new trait-based approach
   - Verify model conversion functionality
   - Ensure compatibility with existing code

## Timeline Update

We're currently ahead of schedule on the registry migration phase, having completed 7 out of 10 registry implementations. This puts us in a good position to begin the model cleanup phase while completing the remaining registry implementations in parallel.

## Technical Debt Reduction

This migration has already reduced technical debt by:
- Eliminating duplicate code across registry implementations
- Creating clear interfaces between registry data and domain models
- Enabling type-safe direct conversion between Arrow data and domain models
- Simplifying the factory pattern implementation

The code is becoming more maintainable, easier to extend, and better organized through this refactoring effort.
